-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total Cross Sections in this directory are from the following sources:

1.n+p elastic (Hydrogen1_el.dat)-> From MCNPx or ENDF.VII sources

2.n+12C elastic (Carbon12_el.dat)-> From ENDF.VII (elastic)+DEMONS (to 1 GeV)

3.n+12C->n'gamma(4.4)+12C (Carbon12_nng4_4.dat)

4.n+12C->a+9Be  (Carbon12_na9Be.dat)

5.n+12C->n'+3a  (Carbon12_nn3a.dat) -> Contains updated data set with total
cross sections from B. Antolkovic et al., Nucl. Phys. A394 (1983), 87. Added
data points to data file plus added point at 90 MeV reported by Del Guerra.
Points after 100 MeV taken from DEMONS (to 1 GeV).
 
6.n+12C->p+12B  (Carbon12_np12B.dat)

7.n+12C->np+11B (Carbon12_nnp11B.dat)

8.n+12C->2n+11C (Carbon12_2n11C.dat)

----9. and 10. added by zwk----

9.n+56Fe elastic (Iron56_el.dat)->From ENDF.VII

10.n+56Fe nonelastic (Iron56_nonel.dat)->From ENDF.VII taken as the diffrence between the total and elastic cross sections.  

----11. and 12. added by zwk----

9.n+27Al elastic (Al27_el.dat)->From ENDF.VII

10.n+27Al nonelastic (Al27_nonel.dat)->From ENDF.VII taken as the diffrence between the total and elastic cross sections.
